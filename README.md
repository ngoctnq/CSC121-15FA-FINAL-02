# Haskell Tic-Tac-Toe
Introduction to Additional Programming Language - Haskell

Issues:
- (not really, it does not affect gameplay by anyway, since movements are input with WASD) left arrows are recognized as right buttons (d's) and up arrows are recognized as left buttons (a's).
- apparently you can win, and I have not handled that situation.

This works on both Linux and Mac, cannot test on Windows because of ANSI, even with ANSICON (Google it).

The game is a deadbeat horse and should be explanatory the moment you run it.
Run by typing "main."
